    "It was necessary to use a windowing function in order to properly divide the data up into bins.  This will enable the filter to reduce high frequency content.  It will also allow it to remove gaussian noise:\n",

    "This demonstrates the filter is smoothing out the waveform and removing high frequency content.  The blue x's represent the original peak energy per frequency.  While we can visually ascertain the pitch is 30 Hz we need to code a basic pitch detection algorithm. Once we can extract the fundamental frequency we can use that later on to figure out Breaths per Minute.\n",

    "After I completed collecting my data using AndroSensor on Android. I tookout a 10 minute section from the middle.  Instead of plotting relationships in Excel/Sheets I laid the phone on my chest and sat in a position where I could read the sensors.  I then carefull went through and looked at each sensor in real time.  What I was looking for were sensors who appeared to have nice sinusoidal waveforms on the application's display.  From this excercise I chose two:\n",

    "##### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from these two examples that the filtering can work both ways to increase the accuracy on smaller samples sizes.  These methods are not full proof.  They tend to work best with Low Frequency waveforms.  Generally anything below 45 Hz.  Filtering helps for higher waveforms but there is always a tradeoff.  Something that is nice, is that the algorithm scales as you modify your sample size.  Hence why the various graphs above worked with different sample sizes.  The general range of results for individual snippets runs from ~0.5 to 30.0 beats per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "*My code runs on my local machine.  There are a few general warnings due to certain data handling methods that have started to be deprecated in newer versions of Python.  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me."
